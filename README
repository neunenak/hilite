hilite is a small command line program that applies a color to the stderr
output of another program. This is useful in, for instance, large compilation
processes where there is a lot of text chatter that would otherwise obscure
legitimate error messages.

Usage example:

$ hilite ls
$ hilite -- ls --color
$ hilite --style cyan -- make --my --make --options
